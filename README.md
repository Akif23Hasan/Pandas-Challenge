#Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
This repository contains the code to perform necessary calculations and create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics for all students and schools within a LGA. 

The following metrics are included:
1) Total number of unique schools
2) Total number of students
3) Total budget
4) Average maths score
5) Average reading score
6) % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
7) % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8) % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

##Data Source
The data for this analysis comes from a dataset of student and school information. The dataset includes information on each student's math and reading scores, as well as information on each school's budget and location.

##Getting Started
To run the analysis, clone this repository and run the PyCitySchools_AnalysisCode-Final.ipynb notebook. The notebook contains the necessary code to read in the data, perform the calculations, and create the summary DataFrame.

##Requirements
The analysis requires the following libraries:
1) pandas
2) numpy
These libraries can be installed using pip.
